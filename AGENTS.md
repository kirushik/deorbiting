#  Orbital Mechanics & Visualization Tool

A Rust + Bevy based Linux desktop app for simulating asteroid deorbiting missions with accurate orbital mechanics and a user-friendly interface.

## Project overview

Desktop GUI app, Google Maps style: 2D view of the solar system with zoom/pan, click-and-drag spacecraft positions and velocity vectors, and real-time orbital mechanics simulation.
Simulation time is adjustable (pause, real-time, fast-forward).
Visual representation of orbits, trajectories, and celestial bodies with accurate physics.
